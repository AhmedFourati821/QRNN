- Data parsing mistakes
- Dimensions aren't fitting
- Number of circuits problem due to n_qubits?
- Slow :o
- Less n_qubits better
- Not quantum recurrent ? x_x
- Add quantum memory for quantum recurrency
- Even slower ðŸ’€
- seperate concerns and split into different files instead of mother file
- fix bugs and test again
